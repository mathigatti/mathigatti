title: about

I am a software developer from Argentina specialized in Data Science and Creative Coding. I have a computer science degree and several years of experience as a programmer and math teacher.

You can check my resume and reviews at [codementor](https://www.codementor.io/mathiasgatti). Tools and projects I developed can be found at my [GitHub](https://github.com/mathigatti). In my spare time I contribute on open source projects like [FoxDot](https://github.com/Qirky/FoxDot/graphs/contributors), a real time music composition framework.

I take part into [bu3nAmigue](https://www.instagram.com/bu3namigue/), an artistic collective that applies technology to the arts.
