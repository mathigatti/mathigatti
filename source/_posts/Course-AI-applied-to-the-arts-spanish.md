In 2020 I gave a course about AI applied to the arts at [WIP - Arte Digital](https://wipartedigital.com/). There students worked in different topics from literature and music to video and image. You can check some of the results [here](https://medium.com/@artedigital.wip/arte-en-colaboraci%C3%B3n-con-m%C3%A1quinas-1e681aa05dfb).
