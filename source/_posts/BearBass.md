# BearBass

I made a synth merging a bear roar with a synth bass, link to the video in the image.

Demo website [here](https://bear.mathigatti.com/).

Source code [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/BearBass).

Alternatively I made [this](https://heart.mathigatti.com/) other website too, that merges a heart beat sound with a bass.
