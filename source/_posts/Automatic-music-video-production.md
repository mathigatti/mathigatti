Automatically generate a music video by extracting scenes from another video.

# Try it on colab

You can try it without installing anything by using [this colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SlTTYvbazihw3nC442UpI8wBVEs68_qp#scrollTo=QqBrD_mVGzA7).


# How it works

## Step 1: Extracting scenes from a video

If the video contains music (i.e it's a music video) the program is going to take advantage of that identifying sections like verse, chorus and bridges, those sections are saved into temp folder, then [scendetect](https://pypi.org/project/scenedetect/) splits these into short clips and saves the result into the _scenes_ folder.

The script has 3 parameters. `VIDEO_PATH`, is the video we want to process. `SCENE_SPLITTER_SENSITIVITY` is an optional `integer` value, it's for tuning the sensitivity of the [scene splitter](https://pyscenedetect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/usage-example/), it's 20 by default. `IS_MUSIC_VIDEO` is an optional `boolean` value, it's True by default.

python scenes_preprocessing.py VIDEO_PATH SCENE_SPLITTER_SENSITIVITY IS_MUSIC_VIDEO

### Using it over the sample file looks like this

`python scenes_preprocessing.py samples/MidnightCity.mp4`

This will generate folders containing the clips inside the _scenes_ folder.

## Step 2: Check everything is fine

Before generating the final video it's a good idea to check if the generated clips look fine. You can delete any clip that you don't like. You can also just mix or delete scenes folders.

## Step 3: Using scenes to create music video

Once we have our folder with video scenes we use it to create a music video. The program first idenfifies the song sections, and calls them "A", "B", "C", ... which map to the folders that contain the scenes. Then it identifies the rhythm of the song and changes of scene on every bar.

`python music_video.py PATH_TOFOLDER_WHERE_SCENES_ARE PATH_TO_SONG`

### Using it over the sample file looks like this

`python music_video.py scenes samples/TimeToPretend.mp3`

This will generate a video called _output_
