Since attention based neural networks were released conversantional AI has improved a lot, that made me consider if it was possible to mantain conversations that are good enough to make us feel some kind of feelings towards our robotic friends.

Deep conversations that take into account long term memory and advanced summarization/abstraction are not technologically possible yet, anyway I thought some feelings, such as sexual arousal, might be produced without requiring such advanced conversational skills. That thought process pushed me to create [ifuckedmycomputer.com](https://ifuckedmycomputer.com/), two telegram bots that can talk to you in sexual terms and share explicit content taken from pornhub.

Special thanks to [Rox Vazquez](https://www.instagram.com/rox_vazquez/) for reviewing the program and designing the website.

The website has been featured into several news portals at the moment:
