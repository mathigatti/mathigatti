Real Time Singing Synthesizer project made from sinsy-NG. The idea was to generate vocal audio samples on real time easily for live coding performances. The code is [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/midi2voice).

## Demo
[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvbV75Tw_24) is a video demonstration using the program to synthesize samples and load them into the FoxDot live coding environment.
