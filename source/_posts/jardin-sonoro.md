On March 2019 I worked on an interactive app which allows people to walk through museums and public parks and receive notifications with descriptions, audios and images when they are close to some relevant place. The first version was exhibited at the Jardin Botanico of Buenos Aires under the title of "Jardin Sonoro". You can check and donwload the app [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jardinsonoro.buenosaires).
