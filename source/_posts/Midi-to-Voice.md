Using the HMM-based Singing Voice Synthesis System from the Nagoya Institute of Technology I implented a [program](https://github.com/mathigatti/midi2voice) to convert music sheets in midi file format into voices that sing the specified notes. [Here](https://soundcloud.com/mathias-gatti/shallow-midi2voice) you can find a sample cover of Lady Gaga - Shallow.
