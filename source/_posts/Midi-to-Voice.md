description: Make your computer sing any song using a midi file
---

Using the HMM-based Singing Voice Synthesis System from the Nagoya Institute of Technology I implented a [program](https://github.com/mathigatti/midi2voice) to convert music sheets in midi file format into voices that sing the specified notes. [Here](https://soundcloud.com/mathias-gatti/shallow-midi2voice) you can find a sample cover of Lady Gaga - Shallow.

You can try it by yourself installing it with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/midi2voice/), the python packages manager. If you don't have python and pip you can try it online with [this colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_lZiwQfuHIVaEFmAibPKUMprZ_0yU35L?usp=sharing).
