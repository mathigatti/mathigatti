Inspired in the work of [Broccaloo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCThULshLB0qiEoL73KxeNbQ) a tried making a new version of the famous song _A day in the life_ using AI.

# How I made it?

[wav2lips](https://bhaasha.iiit.ac.in/lipsync/) is used for the video and [OpenAI's Jukebox](https://www.google.com/search?q=open+ai+jukebox&oq=open+ai+jukebox&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59j69i64l3j69i60l3.5567j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) for the music. The first seconds of the song are the original ones from _A day in the life_, then the AI tries to continue it.
