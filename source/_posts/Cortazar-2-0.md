I trained a [Neural Network](https://github.com/Kyubyong/dc_tts) to be able to speak like [Julio Cortazar](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julio_Cort%C3%A1zar) and made this video.

Then I uploaded the model to the internet so it's accessible for anyone through [this website](http://voces.mathigatti.com/).
