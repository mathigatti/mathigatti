summary: Melanoma identification quiz (WIP)

I'm working on a basic quiz website focused on training people to differentiate malignant moles (melanoma or non melanoma cancer) from benign moles and other skin marks. Mole images come from ISIC Archive.

You can try the website [here](https://moles.mathigatti.com/) and check the code [here](https://github.com/mathigatti/SkinCancerTraining). The website still needs more work and testing it with real doctors, it doesn't work as a serious training at all.
