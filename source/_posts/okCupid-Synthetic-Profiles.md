On January 2021 I discovered [humansofunrealcity](https://www.instagram.com/humansofunrealcity/) an awesome instagram account that uses GPT-2 to create fake stories in the style of [humansofnewyork](https://www.humansofnewyork.com/). After I saw that I reached Julian Koplin the creator of the project and I discussed with him my idea of using a collection of thousands of self descriptions from people around the world that I scraped from the dating website [OkCupid](http://okcupid.com/), he really liked the idea so we started working on this project.

I attach some results here, you can check more of them in the humansofunrealcity instagram account.
