summary: Generating 3D Mesh Models from Single RGB Images.

After [this paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ECCV_2018/papers/Nanyang_Wang_Pixel2Mesh_Generating_3D_ECCV_2018_paper.pdf) was published showing how to convert a simple image into a 3D mesh I tried the [open source code](https://github.com/nywang16/Pixel2Mesh) and It was a little bit trickey to use, so I developed [this](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13xkSkvPaF5GU6Wpf35nVHUdP77oBVHlT#scrollTo=xXxbMrF4fdZs) online version using colab.

In my experience the conversion doesn't work so well but I guess it might be useful for someone anyway :)
