Based on the count of google results we can infer the popularity of a word. Also the relationship between the frequency of two words together with respect to its individual frequency is a useful measure of how much two words are related.

Based on these ideas is defined the [Normalized Google distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalized_Google_distance), in [this](https://www.codementor.io/@mathiasgatti/python-implementation-of-normalized-google-distance-simple-web-scraping-example-vrwwu5w58) post I show how to implement it in python using basic web scraping tools. The final code can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/mathigatti/aa12d484ad545e909e48bfa080a11eae).
